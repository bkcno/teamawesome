Notes:  Local government data are estimates subject to sampling variability.,,,,,,,,,,
"Federal Government data are for the fiscal period beginning October 1, 2004 and ending September 30, 2005."
"a/ The total lines for each criminal justice activity, and for the total justice system, exclude duplicative intergovernmental amounts.  "
This was done to avoid the artificial inflation that would result if an intergovernmental expenditure of a government were tabulated and then counted again when the recipient government(s) expended the amount. 
The intergovernmental expenditure lines are not totaled for the same reason.
